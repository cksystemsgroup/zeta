	/**
	 * In each task we calculate the overlappings of one particular operation.

	 * check if they are overlapping. For all operations this means quadratic
	 * complexity. Only the operations in a subinterval of the whole array of
	 * operations can overlap with the given operation. The operations are
	 * sorted by the starting time. The starting time defines the upper bound of
	 * the interval because we compare the starting time with the end time of
	 * the given operation. The upper bound can be found easily by a binary
	 * search. For the lower bound we precalculate an additional array. At index
	 * i it contains an index j such that operations[j] is the first operation
	 * in the array with its end time later than the operation operations[i].
	 * 
	 * @param task
	 *            The task provides the array of operations, it is the same for
	 *            all tasks.
